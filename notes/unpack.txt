A good way to check unpack of blackcipher is to do run bat with. Works with all blackcipher apps but not game.

start blackcipher.aes /showinstance

if (it shows then)
  winlic is there
else if (error)
  you goofed the unpack
else 
   nothing then no winlic

finally
  you can unpack the huge as fuck vm junk code
